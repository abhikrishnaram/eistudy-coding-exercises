- [Exercise 1: Design Patterns](./exercise_1)
- [Exercise 2: Rocket Launch Simulator](./exercise_2)

## Exercise 2: Rocket Launch Simulator

### Problem Statement

The second exercise involves building a terminal-based rocket launch simulator. The goal is to simulate a rocket launch that places a satellite into orbit while providing real-time updates to the user. The simulator operates in discrete time steps, each representing one second of the mission.

### Features

- Simulates a rocket launch that places a satellite into orbit.
- Provides real-time updates on fuel, altitude, and speed.
- Supports user commands for pre-launch checks, launch initiation, and fast-forwarding.
- Colorful console output for better readability.
- Comprehensive error handling and logging.

## Installation
