# Rocket Launch Simulator

A terminal-based rocket launch simulator implemented in TypeScript. This project simulates the process of launching a rocket, providing real-time updates on fuel, altitude, and speed, while allowing user interaction through commands.

## Features

- Simulates a rocket launch that places a satellite into orbit.
- Provides real-time updates on fuel, altitude, and speed.
- Supports user commands for pre-launch checks, launch initiation, and fast-forwarding.
- Colorful console output for better readability.
- Comprehensive error handling and logging.
